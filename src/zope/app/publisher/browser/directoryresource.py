"""Resource Directory

A 'resource directory' is an on-disk directory which is registered as
a resource using the <resourceDirectory> ZCML directive.  The
directory is treated as a source for individual resources; it can be
traversed to retrieve resources represented by contained files, which
can in turn be treated as resources.  The contained files have
__name__ values which include a '/' separating the __name__ of the
resource directory from the name of the file within the directory.
