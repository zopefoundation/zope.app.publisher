3.5a1
=====

- <browser:menuItem> can now be registered for classes.

- Added a `layer` attribute to `xmlrpc:view`. This works just like layers for
  `browser:view` etc. but uses the `IXMLRPCSkinType`.

After 3.4.0a1
=============

 - Fixed a bug about xmlrpc:view: Omitting a permission was (widely)
   documented to be allowed when a name is given and should incorporate the
   original security settings of the view class. This did not work at all and
   the permission was always required. It now works as described.


Before 3.4
==========

This package was part of the Zope 3 distribution and did not have its own
CHANGES.txt. For earlier changes please refer to either our subversion log or
the CHANGES.txt of earlier Zope 3 releases.
